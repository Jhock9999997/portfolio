## Featured Projects

### Analyzing TCP Behavior: Security Threats and Mitigation Strategies
**Description:** This project focused on analyzing and mitigating network security threats by evaluating TCP connection behavior, identifying vulnerabilities, and proposing defensive measures. Using tools like Wireshark and ns-3, the study examines network traffic patterns, SYN flood attacks, and the impact of security implementations on performance.

**Key Objectives:**
- Identifying abnormal TCP behavior (e.g., SYN flood attacks)
- Assessing network performance under different security conditions
- Proposing effective mitigation strategies for improving security and efficiency

**Technologies:** Wireshark, ns-3, Linux Networking

### Assignment 2: Research Report ‚Äì Fuzzing TinyCC
**Description:** In this project, I applied AFL (American Fuzzy Lop) to the Tiny C Compiler (TCC), conducting an intense 13-hour fuzzing session. Through carefully designed test cases and AFL‚Äôs instrumentation, I systematically explored TCC‚Äôs execution paths, identifying vulnerabilities and improving compiler resilience.

**Key Aspects:**
- Implemented AFL fuzzing techniques for automated vulnerability hunting
- Optimized fuzzing environment and seed inputs for effective test coverage
- Analyzed execution trends to maximize test case exploration

**Technologies:** AFL Fuzzing, TinyCC, Linux Debugging Tools

### University Homelab Setup for Security Research and Development
**Description:** This project involves setting up a virtualized environment using Oracle VirtualBox to support university assignments related to security research, networking, and software testing. The homelab consists of multiple Ubuntu-based virtual machines configured for penetration testing, secure software development, and network analysis.

**Key Configurations:**
- **Primary VM (Ubuntu_2024):** Main development environment with VirtualBox Guest Additions for improved performance.
- **Isolated Test VMs (virtpc1-virtpc4):** Dedicated instances for running security experiments, network simulations, and fuzz testing.
- **Networking Setup:** Combination of NAT and internal network adapters to simulate real-world network topologies.
- **Resource Allocation:** Optimized memory and CPU distribution for balanced performance.

**Technologies:** VirtualBox, Ubuntu, Linux Networking, Security Tools (AFL, GDB, Wireshark)
