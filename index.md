## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔍 Analyzing TCP Behavior: Security Threats and Mitigation Strategies
**📌 Description:** This project focused on analyzing and mitigating network security threats by evaluating TCP connection behavior, identifying vulnerabilities, and proposing defensive measures. Using tools like Wireshark and ns-3, the study examined network traffic patterns, SYN flood attacks, and the impact of security implementations on performance.

**🎯 Key Objectives:**
- 🧠 Identifying abnormal TCP behavior (e.g., SYN flood attacks)
- 📉 Assessing network performance under different security conditions
- 🛡️ Proposing effective mitigation strategies for improving security and efficiency

**🛠️ Technologies:** `Wireshark` `ns-3` `Linux Networking`

### ⚙️ Assignment 2: Research Report – Fuzzing TinyCC
**📌 Description:** In this project, I applied AFL (American Fuzzy Lop) to the Tiny C Compiler (TCC), conducting an intense 13-hour fuzzing session. Through carefully designed test cases and AFL’s instrumentation, I systematically explored TCC’s execution paths, identifying vulnerabilities and improving compiler resilience.

**🧪 Key Aspects:**
- 🧬 Implemented AFL fuzzing techniques for automated vulnerability hunting
- 🧠 Optimized fuzzing environment and seed inputs for effective test coverage
- 📊 Analyzed execution trends to maximize test case exploration

**🛠️ Technologies:** `AFL Fuzzing` `TinyCC` `Linux Debugging Tools`

### 🧰 University Homelab Setup for Security Research and Development
**📌 Description:** This project involves setting up a virtualized environment using Oracle VirtualBox to support university assignments related to security research, networking, and software testing. The homelab consists of multiple Ubuntu-based virtual machines configured for penetration testing, secure software development, and network analysis.

**🔧 Key Configurations:**
- 💻 **Primary VM (Ubuntu_2024):** Main development environment with VirtualBox Guest Additions for improved performance.
- 🧪 **Isolated Test VMs (virtpc1-virtpc4):** Dedicated instances for running security experiments, network simulations, and fuzz testing.
- 🌐 **Networking Setup:** Combination of NAT and internal network adapters to simulate real-world network topologies.
- ⚙️ **Resource Allocation:** Optimized memory and CPU distribution for balanced performance.

**🛠️ Technologies:** `VirtualBox` `Ubuntu` `Linux Networking` `Security Tools (AFL, GDB, Wireshark)`
