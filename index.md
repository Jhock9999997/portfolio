# Project Highlights from University

Here’s a quick overview of some of the practical and technical projects I completed during my postgraduate studies in cybersecurity and networking. These projects reflect my hands-on experience with network analysis, secure systems, fuzzing, and setting up development environments. I have created a separate repository for each one to display the projects in more detail.

## About Me

I’m a recent graduate from QUT with a Graduate Diploma in Cybersecurity and Networking, now based in the UK after relocating from Australia. I also hold a Bachelor's degree in Psychological Science and a CompTIA Security+ certificate.

With a growing passion for IT and cybersecurity, I’m eager to dive deeper into the field, contribute to real-world security challenges, and continue learning and evolving within the cybersecurity space.

## Featured Projects

### Analyzing TCP Behavior: Security Threats and Mitigation Strategies
**Description:**  
This project focused on analyzing and mitigating network security threats by evaluating TCP connection behavior, identifying vulnerabilities, and proposing defensive measures. Using tools like Wireshark and ns-3, the study examined network traffic patterns, SYN flood attacks, and the impact of security implementations on performance.

**Key Objectives:**
- Identifying abnormal TCP behavior (e.g., SYN flood attacks)
- Assessing network performance under different security conditions
- Proposing effective mitigation strategies for improving security and efficiency

**Technologies:** `Wireshark` `ns-3` `Linux Networking`

### Assignment 2: Research Report – Fuzzing TinyCC
**Description:**  
In this project, I applied AFL (American Fuzzy Lop) to the Tiny C Compiler (TCC), conducting an intense 13-hour fuzzing session. Through carefully designed test cases and AFL’s instrumentation, I systematically explored TCC’s execution paths, identifying vulnerabilities and improving compiler resilience.

**Key Aspects:**
- Implemented AFL fuzzing techniques for automated vulnerability hunting
- Optimized fuzzing environment and seed inputs for effective test coverage
- Analyzed execution trends to maximize test case exploration

**Technologies:** `AFL Fuzzing` & `Linux Debugging Tools`

### University Homelab Setup for Security Research and Development
**Description:**  
This project involves setting up a virtualized environment using Oracle VirtualBox to support university assignments related to security research, networking, and software testing. The homelab consists of multiple Ubuntu-based virtual machines configured for penetration testing, secure software development, and network analysis.

Key Configurations:

Primary VM (Ubuntu_2024): Main development environment with VirtualBox Guest Additions for improved performance.
Isolated Test VMs (virtpc1-virtpc4): Dedicated instances for running security experiments, network simulations, and fuzz testing.
Networking Setup: Combination of NAT and internal network adapters to simulate real-world network topologies.
Resource Allocation: Optimized memory and CPU distribution for balanced performance.

Technologies: VirtualBox Ubuntu Linux Networking Security Tools (AFL, GDB, Wireshark)
